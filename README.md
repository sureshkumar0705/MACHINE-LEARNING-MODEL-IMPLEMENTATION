This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a machine learning pipeline using Python. It covers data loading, preprocessing, training a Random Forest classifier, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- **Load Dataset:** Read a CSV file containing the dataset.
- **Preprocess Data:** Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- **Train-Test Split:** Divide data into training and testing subsets.
- **Model Training:** Train a Random Forest Classifier.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy score.

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries before running the code:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the full implementation of the ML pipeline.
- `path/to/your/dataset.csv`: Example placeholder for your dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace `path/to/your/dataset.csv` with the path to your dataset.
3. Set the `target_column` variable to the name of the target column in your dataset.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example

Assuming you have a dataset called `data.csv` with a target column named `target`, update the file path and column name in the code:

```python
file_path = "data.csv"
target_column = "target"
```

Run the script to see the model's accuracy printed to the console:

```bash
Model Accuracy: 85.67%
```

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for:

- Missing or invalid file paths.
- Empty or improperly formatted datasets.
- Columns with entirely missing values.
- Missing target column.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for hyperparameter tuning.
- Add feature importance visualization.
- Extend support to other classification algorithms.
